[How to set up local instance]
Download tomcat and extract it to a directory of your choice.
Change the default runtime environment in eclipse to JRE 1.7! Any JRE higher than this will mean that the code you write will not run on the EC2 instance.
Import the servlet-api.jar file from your tomcat installation as an external Jar to your project build path.
Set up a tomcat 7 server in eclipse whose runtime environment points to your tomcat install.
To run, run on server and select the new server you just created.
